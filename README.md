# ðŸ§  LangGraph Concepts â€“ Compact Summary

This repository serves as a quick reference and implementation overview for core LangGraph concepts using `langgraph`, a powerful framework built on top of LangChain that brings **stateful, multi-agent workflows** with graph-based logic to life.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts Covered

- **Sequential Flow**:  
  Executing nodes one after the other in a defined order using a basic graph structure.

- **Conditional Branching**:  
  Directing the flow based on logic/conditions. Great for use-cases like filtering or dynamic agent routing.

- **Looping Mechanism**:  
  Nodes can be revisited until a certain condition is met â€” useful for retry logic, iterative refinement, or feedback loops.
